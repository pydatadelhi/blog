**Why should you be a part of PyData Organisation?**

So, are you wondering, what is so special about PyData? What sets the PyData commumity apart?

Here's a list ( not an exhaustive one and definitely not the only points! ) I as a PyData Delhi member I have made:

* Why should I only support PyData? There are so many more communities out there! Why join in a PyData Conference or a Meetup? Well, simply because PyData conference proceeds go to NumFOCUS, who in turn are the supporter of many open source projects like Julia, NumPy, Jupyter and more. 
In short, we __give back__ to the community, and encourage financial as well as community support of open-source tools.

* We have an amazing community! The PyData community, and the experiences I have had with them till now, have all been great and extremely uplifting. We have __good inter-community support__ as well as __regular meetups__, where we discuss and solve the problems our community members face. We are a friendly and a diverse group focused on __individual as well as collective intellectual growth__ . We help out each other!

* We have really __good speakers and sessions__ on the latest buzz in technology and the world of Python. There are __advanced topics and talks__, and as a member, I got to witness these speakers, introducing us newbies to awesome and mind boggling tech, and we all keep coming back for more- better conversations and learning at every step.

There are a numerous other reasons, including how PyData helps me feel about giving back to my local community and supporting diverse initiatives in technical communities.
Infact, being an organiser for PyData Delhi 2017 has given me a high and a rush like no other. I feel proud to be a part of such an active community and give back to the community by helping my peers and introducing them to open-source. The experience with my fellow Organising Team members has been amazing so far and we can't wait for September to arrive!
So whatever your personal reasons maybe, I hope that listing down a few of mine have given you something to dwell upon. Go on, join a [community](https://www.meetup.com/pro/pydata/) near you and be a part of change and growth.
Perhaps, it has motivated you to attend the upcoming PyData Delhi conference [PyData Delhi conference](https://pydata.org/delhi2017/) ! Ciao, and see you there folks!
